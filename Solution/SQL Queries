Question 1
Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data.
The method used evaluates the sum of order_amount divided by the count of orders_amount(counting the rows), A better way to evaluate this is by using this syntax:
"Select SUM(order_amount)/SUM(total_items)
FROM "2019_Winter_Data_Science_Intern_Challenge_Data_Set" wdsicds". Which divides Sum(order_amount) by the SUM(total_items) i.e(Qty ordered) and not Count of Orders.

What metric would you report for this dataset?
"Select SUM(order_amount)/SUM(total_items)
FROM "2019_Winter_Data_Science_Intern_Challenge_Data_Set" wdsicds"

What is its value?
$357 AOV

Question 2
How many orders were shipped by Speedy Express in total?
SELECT Count(o.orderID), s.ShipperName
FROM [Orders] o
INNER JOIN Shippers s
ON o.shipperID = s.shipperID
WHERE ShipperName = 'Speedy Express'

ANS = 54 Orders

What is the last name of the employee with the most orders?
SELECT Count(O.EmployeeID) TOTAL_ORDERS, E.LastName
FROM [Orders] O
INNER JOIN Employees E
ON O.EmployeeID = E.EmployeeID
GROUP BY 2
ORDER BY 1 DESC
LIMIT 1

ANS = Peacock 40 Orders

What product was ordered the most by customers in Germany?
SELECT SUM(od.quantity) TotalOrderedQty, p.productName
FROM [Customers] c
LEFT JOIN Orders o
ON c.customerID = o.customerID
LEFT JOIN OrderDetails od
ON od.orderID = o.orderiD
LEFT JOIN Products p
ON od.productID = p.productID
WHERE c.country = 'Germany'
GROUP BY 2
ORDER BY 1 DESC
LIMIT 1
